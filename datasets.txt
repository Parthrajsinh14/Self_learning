There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.

**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.


List 
  List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.  and that order will not change.
  If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
  The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

  thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"] 
  print(thislist)
